# ETH-Unity

ETH-Unity develops tools that integrate Ethereum blockchain functionality into Unity-based multiplayer environments.

## Projects

-   **UnityNethereum**  
    A Unity project combining multiplayer interactions (via Unity's Netcode for GameObjects) with Ethereum integration. It enables in-game wallet connections, Ether transactions, and smart contract interactions.
    
-   **EthNetwork**  
    Provides the blockchain backend for UnityNethereum, including a local GoQuorum testnet and smart contracts for user-to-user and user-to-device interactions.
    

## Use Cases

-   In-game asset transfers using Ethereum.
    
-   Access control for digital or physical spaces via smart contracts.
    
-   Simulated IoT interactions (e.g., doors, sensors) within multiplayer environments.
